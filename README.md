“Healthcare System”, as our final year project. Healthcare System is a smart web application, the main 
idea of this work is to provide ease and comfort to patients while taking appointment from doctors and take 
the proper consultation from doctor. For doctorschedule as per their time and consult maximum patients. To 
Achieve this I used Html, css, php and Javascript programming languages. Also I used XAMPP server for the 
database connectivity.
